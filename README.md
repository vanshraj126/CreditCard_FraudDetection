# CreditCard_FraudDetection

# Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
ðŸš€ A machine learning-based fraud detection system trained using Random Forest and Balanced Random Forest, with resampling techniques to handle class imbalance.

ðŸ“Œ Features

Implements Random Forest Classifier for fraud detection
Uses Balanced Random Forest for improved performance on imbalanced datasets
Data preprocessing with oversampling techniques (SMOTE, Random Oversampling)
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Deployable with Flask and ngrok for real-world usage
ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, pandas, NumPy, Flask

ðŸ“Œ Future Enhancements

âœ… Improve feature engineering
âœ… Tune hyperparameters for better performance
âœ… Integrate with a real-time fraud detection system

DataSet used:
     -> kaggle/credit_card_2023.csv 
        This dataset is used to train the model and perform initial testing.
     -> synthetic_test_data.csv 
        This was used to test the working of the model to check its accuracy and all.
