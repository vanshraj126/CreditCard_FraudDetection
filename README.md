# Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
🚀 A machine learning-based fraud detection system trained using Random Forest and Balanced Random Forest, with resampling techniques to handle class imbalance.

📌 Features

Implements Random Forest Classifier for fraud detection
Uses Balanced Random Forest for improved performance on imbalanced datasets
Data preprocessing with oversampling techniques (SMOTE, Random Oversampling)
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Deployable with Flask and ngrok for real-world usage
🛠 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, pandas, NumPy, Flask

📌 Future Enhancements

✅ Improve feature engineering
✅ Tune hyperparameters for better performance
✅ Integrate with a real-time fraud detection system
